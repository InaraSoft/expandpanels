TO-DO:

- simplyfy everything with verctor addition and scalar multiplication (orthogonal basis vectors... and so on)
      if horizonatal and vertical would be described by a unity vector, I could calculate if a certain operation should be performed
      and I could just multiply the basis vector  with an operation to get a delta movement (or none)



Known Bugs:

- the TExpandPanels lacks a arrange on bottom and right

- the TExpandPanels Width of the first panel is 4 pixel too big the first time
   maybe the Paint Rect of TMyRollout uncorrect... closing and reopening correct it
   (see demo: the panel with calendar)

- (Solved?) Button.Color Setted to clBtnFace at DesignTime -> Color = clSkyBlue in RunTime
    (is not Loaded because is The inherited Default Color of TCustomSpeedButton)

- Expand with - collapse Bottom, position Left/Right  (That is a NO Sense Use)
                collapse Right, position Top/Bottom  have some sub-panel resize problem.
                
- Partial Animated Expand don' t give space to paint animation or is uncorrectly painted.
