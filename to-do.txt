TO-DO:

- MaxM: Fix Shadows incoerence when Button.Style is bbsTab, the Panel attached side may not have borders.
        Add new Styles bbsLine and bbsDoubleLine

- simplyfy everything with verctor addition and scalar multiplication (orthogonal basis vectors... and so on)
      if horizonatal and vertical would be described by a unity vector, I could calculate if a certain operation should be performed
      and I could just multiply the basis vector  with an operation to get a delta movement (or none)



Known Bugs:

- the TExpandPanels lacks a arrange on bottom and right

- (Solved?) Button.Color Setted to clBtnFace at DesignTime -> Color = clSkyBlue in RunTime
    (is not Loaded because is The inherited Default Color of TCustomSpeedButton)
